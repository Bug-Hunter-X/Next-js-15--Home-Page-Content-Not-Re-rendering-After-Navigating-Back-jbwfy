# Next.js 15 Home Page Re-render Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar re-rendering issue in a Next.js 15 application.  The application has two pages: a home page and an about page. Navigating to the about page and then back to the home page using the browser's back button does not trigger a re-render of the home page content.  The initial content is displayed, but updates to the home page (e.g. dynamic data) will not be reflected.  This behavior can be subtle and difficult to diagnose.

## Bug Description

The issue is related to how Next.js 15 handles back/forward navigation.  The application structure is simple and should not inherently cause this issue.  The bug showcases how Next.js might not always correctly re-render pages during back navigation.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`
5. Use your browser's back button to return to `/`
6. Observe that home page content might not reflect any updates made since the initial render.

## Potential Solutions

Investigating and understanding the root cause of this re-rendering behavior within Next.js 15 framework is crucial.  Possible solutions include ensuring proper data fetching mechanisms, potentially adding manual re-renders, or addressing any underlying caching strategies.
